abstract: The extraordinary conditions such as war, civil conflict, epidemic,
  natural disaster may require a sudden transformation of the established
  education systems. A similar transformation came true in the first quarter of
  the current year due to the COVID-19, which emerged at the end of 2019 and
  spread globally. In this process, face-to-face education activities have
  transformed into distance education equivalents. The current study aims to
  examine the experiences of undergraduate students in the emergency transition
  process of residential courses to distance education in higher education
  institutions. Seventy undergraduate students (22 male and 48 female) from 24
  different departments of 16 universities were recruited into the study based
  on the maximum variation sampling technique. The data were collected in the
  third week following the decision of the council of higher education to
  transition to distance education in the 2020-Spring term. Student reflections
  on pluses and minuses of the emergency distance education process were
  analyzed through content analysis. The agreement percentage between coders (n
  = 3) was calculated as 92%. It was determined that most of the students
  (approximately 80%) have concerns about emergency distance education or
  develop a negative attitude towards it. The change in students' resident order
  formed an important difficulty in providing the necessary infrastructure
  conditions and suitable environmental arrangements for distance education. In
  addition, uncertainties in the academic calendar and online exams were
  ascertained to be among the leading causes of anxiety. It was found that the
  balance of synchronous and asynchronous components related to online courses,
  student characteristics, pre-qualifications regarding distance education,
  in-class communication and interaction patterns are among the most important
  determinants of students' perspectives on distance education. It was revealed
  that distance education differs from face-to-face education in terms of
  cognitive process management and students have difficulty in coping with this
  difference. It was found that theorizing practical knowledge without authentic
  conditions and environmental contexts creates a limitation in the acquisition
  of practical skills. The results indicate that the teaching modality of the
  courses should not be carried out independently from the instructional
  designs; moreover, just the transfer of the courses into the Web environment
  is not sufficient for the students‘ interest and engagement in the 46 courses.
