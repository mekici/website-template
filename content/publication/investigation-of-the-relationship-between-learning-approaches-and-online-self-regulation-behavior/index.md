  In this research, researchers aim to contribute to current literature on
  self-regulation by investigating the relationship between learning approaches
  and online self-regulation behavior. In this study, we use learning approaches
  as a predictor of online self-regulation skills. Sub factors of online
  self-regulation skills; environmental structuring, goal setting, time
  management, help-seeking, task strategies, self-evaluation are dependent
  variables and sub-factors of the learning approaches; deep approach, surface
  approach are independent variables. Research data collected from 303 college
  students who attended online distance courses at Usak University. Regression
  analysis showed that learning approaches are significant predictors of online
  self-regulation skills.
